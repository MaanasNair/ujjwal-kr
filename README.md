### Hey there!

## I'm Building the [@hackarmour](https://github.com/hackarmour)
- We build, distribute and collect hacking, security and testing resources and mechanisms.
- To join the org, you can text us in [our discord server](https://discord.gg/z7Rvj3b5C5).

## I'm also working on [EpicTracker (ip-sniff) ](https://github.com/ujjwal-kr/ip-sniff)
- It is a demonstration project of how can I track you using fingerprinting and some automated lookups and stuff.
- It uses modern Javascript APIs to intentify your metadata and keeps the information in a cookie, encrypting it.
- I will make a machine learning algorithm in future which will try to match the encrypted cookies to figure out the target.
- I may create dummy marketing services to demonstrate the (targeted ads) tracking process close to the realworld.
